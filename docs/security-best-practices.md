# 🛡️ Security Best Practices

## Prevention Measures

### Path Traversal Prevention

- Properly configure web server (nginx/Apache) to restrict directory access
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use absolute paths and avoid relative path construction
- Implement proper access controls

### File Upload Security

- Validate file types and extensions
- Store uploaded files outside the web root
- Never execute uploaded files directly
- Implement proper file permissions
- Scan uploaded files for malicious content

### Reverse Shell Prevention

- Implement network egress filtering (block outbound connections to unknown IPs)
- Use application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized code execution
- Monitor for unusual network connections and processes
- Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
- Use security groups/firewalls to restrict outbound traffic

### Cloud Security (AWS/EC2)

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant the minimum permissions needed
- Use specific resource ARNs instead of wildcards (`*`)
- Implement IAM permission boundaries
- Regularly audit IAM roles and policies with AWS Access Analyzer
- Enable CloudTrail logging to monitor API calls
- Use AWS IMDSv2 (Instance Metadata Service v2) to prevent SSRF attacks on metadata
- Implement VPC endpoints for AWS services instead of internet routing
- Enable GuardDuty for threat detection
- Use AWS Organizations SCPs (Service Control Policies) for guardrails

## 🔍 Example: Secure IAM Instance Role

Instead of overly permissive policies, use specific permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::specific-bucket-name/specific-prefix/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:/aws/ec2/app-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 💡 Key Takeaway: Defense in Depth

This demo shows why **defense in depth** is crucial. A single vulnerability is bad, but when combined with:

- Weak network controls (allowing reverse shells)
- Overly permissive cloud IAM roles
- Lack of monitoring and detection
- Missing segmentation between services

...the impact multiplies exponentially. Each security layer that fails gives attackers more power and persistence.
