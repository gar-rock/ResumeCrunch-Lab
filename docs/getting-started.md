# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Docker Desktop** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) *make sure this comes with docker-compose*
2. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gar-rock/ResumeCrunch.git
cd ResumeCrunch
```
*Preferable to use linux or macOS for this lab, Windows may have issues with some commands*

That's it! You're ready to start the labs.

**Note:** If you would like to actually use the ResumeCrunch application locally you can set the Open AI API key as an environment variable in your shell:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```
