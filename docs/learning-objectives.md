# ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By exploring this vulnerable application, you should learn:

- How path traversal attacks work and their impact
- The dangers of improper file upload handling
- How architectural flaws can lead to severe security issues
- The importance of secure coding practices
- How to identify and mitigate common web vulnerabilities
- **How reverse shells enable persistent attacker access**
- **The cascading impact of cloud misconfigurations**
- **Why IAM least privilege is critical in cloud environments**
- **How a single compromised server can lead to full AWS account takeover**

## Understanding the Attack Chain

### Local Vulnerabilities â†’ Remote Access â†’ Cloud Compromise

1. **Initial Foothold**: Path traversal or file upload vulnerability
2. **Code Execution**: Ability to run arbitrary code on the server
3. **Persistent Access**: Reverse shell for interactive control
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Leveraging cloud IAM roles
5. **Lateral Movement**: Accessing other AWS resources and services

## Why This Matters

Understanding these vulnerabilities in a controlled environment helps you:

- Recognize security anti-patterns in code reviews
- Design more secure architectures from the ground up
- Implement proper defense-in-depth strategies
- Appreciate the interconnected nature of security controls
- Understand the attacker's perspective and methodology

## Responsible Security Testing

?> Always remember: With knowledge comes responsibility. Use these skills ethically and legally.

- Only test systems you own or have explicit written permission to test
- Follow responsible disclosure practices when finding real vulnerabilities
- Never use these techniques for malicious purposes
